# Futuregram
<br/>

A Social media webapp similar to Instagram. Made because I kinda enjoy making full-stack webapps üëç.
Btw, the last time I tried to make something more complicated with SvelteKit and a BaaS, it didn't end up well (with that I don't mean the URL Shortener, but CodeConnect).

But I think, that it was because I was a beginner and I used <span style="color:yellow">Firebase</span>. And I didn't even use it the right way - the file structure was basicly ~~f*cked~~ **screwed** and I constantly had problems with user auth.

__However__ I think, that this one will turn out to be good.

And also, I'm making all of my projects myself, with no tutorials whatsoever, because watching someone code for 5 hours **isn't the right way** to learn programming.

## Technologies/languages this project uses:

## Database schema
Btw I'm using supabase's database, which means it's Postgres.
